    <h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Personal Info</h2>
<p>My name is Juan Duque, I am 23 years old up to August, 2023 when I am creating this website. I live in Cali, Colombia and I was also born here. I am a sensible and detail oriented person, reason why I'm spending so much time doing this website to make it look nice and responsive.</p>
<h3>More about me:</h3>
<p>I have no idea of what a Biography should say in this case so I changed the title to "More about me", anyway, I was born on March 12th, 2000 in Cali, Colombia. My childhood and early memories allowed me to understand that I was kind of different. Later on I found that I was anxious, reason why I overthink all the time, I wanted to know how everything in the world works and always needed to confirm evrything that was told to me. I considered myself as someone different and therefore I didn't fit with the other kids. I finally understood more about myself in my early 20's when I started learning more about psycology, I understood how my mind worked and I started working on multiple ways to improve my behaviors and unconscious reactions.</p>
