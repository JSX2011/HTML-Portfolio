    <h1>Movies and Series Ranking by Juan Duque</h1>
<h2>This movie ranking display my favorite movies and series from 1 to 3 of all time.</h2>
<hr>
<h2>1. Mr. Nobody</h2>
<pr>Basicaly a guy living a normal shitty life but with good music and a nice narration.</pr>
<h2>2. The Witcher - Complete Series</h2>
<p>Basically, the best looking guy in Hollywood (for the mid 30's women and older) with long white hair and a long silver sword slaying monsters and pus... Witches, altogether. Any man's dream, basically.</p>
<h2>The Last Of Us - Complete Series(TLOU for the friends)</h2>
<p>Post Apocalyptic world where a bad-ass guy lose his daughter and starts building his career as a survivor mercenary. The history, actors and scenaries are accurate to the game with some minor but well done changes that I enjoyed watching a lot.</p>
