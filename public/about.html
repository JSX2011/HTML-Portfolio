<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Personal Info</h2>
<p>My name is Juan Duque, I am 23 years old up to August, 2023 when I am creating this website. I live in Cali, Colombia and I was also born here. (More details in my Bio [That I most likely won't write]) I am a sensible and detail oriented person, reason why I'm spending so much time doing this "Test website" that most likely won't be seen by anyone. xd</p>
<h3>Biography</h3>
<p>I have no idea of what a Biography should say but, anyway, I was born on March 12th, 2000. I was born almost dead since my mom suffered of eclampsia and I was in the hospital for God knows how long. Anyway, my childhood and early experiences were filled with some interesting memories of spiritual things and some common traumas, but nothing worth mentioning to the public as for now.</p>
